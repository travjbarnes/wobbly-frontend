## Ways to Contribute

* Say hi! We hang out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KxC96yY) and our [Discourse forum](https://discourse.wobbly.app/).
* [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/Wobbly-app/wobbly-frontend/issues)
  * Issues can be created in the form of bug reports or helpful suggestions
* Update our documentation
  * If you see anything missing from our [README](README.md) or [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) docs that should be included, feel free to add it
* Write more tests
  * [About testing with Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
* Fix bugs or build new features
  * Please identify what you would like to work on in Github Issues first (so as to prevent duplication of effort)
* Please use the app, and provide us feedback!

## Pull requests
* All status checks must pass before a PR can be merged.
* Every PR requires a new entry in `CHANGELOG.md`. If your change is very small and you don't think a changelog entry is necessary, simply use the string `#trivial` in your PR title or body -- then you'll override this check.
